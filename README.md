AI-Augmented Attendance Workflows Presentation
This is an interactive HTML presentation designed for Hartley Brook Primary Academy to demonstrate how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be embedded into attendance management workflows to improve efficiency and reduce administrative burdens. It's intended to be a visual and auditory aid for a strategic discussion with the Astrea Academy Trust.

Features
Slide-by-Slide Navigation: Move through the presentation slides using "Previous" and "Next" buttons.

Keyboard Navigation: Use left and right arrow keys for easy slide navigation.

Audio Narration: Each slide includes an audio track that automatically plays when the slide becomes active.

Audio Play/Pause Control: A dedicated button allows users to play or pause the audio for the current slide.

Progress Bar: A visual progress bar at the top indicates your current position in the presentation.

Responsive Design: The presentation layout adapts to different screen sizes for optimal viewing on various devices.

Fixed Slide Position: Slides appear one at a time in a fixed, central location on the screen.

Setup and Usage
To view and use this presentation:

Save the file: Copy the entire HTML code and save it as an .html file (e.g., attendance_presentation.html) on your computer.

Host Audio Files: The presentation is designed to play audio narration for each slide. These audio files (e.g., slide1.mp3, slide2.mp3, etc.) are currently referenced from a placeholder GitHub repository.

Crucially, you need to upload your actual audio files to a public web server or a public GitHub repository.

Once uploaded, update the src attribute of each <audio> tag in the HTML file to point to the correct URL of your hosted audio files. For example, if your audio files are at https://your-github-username.github.io/your-repo/audio/slide1.mp3, you would replace https://example.com/github-audio-repo/ with https://your-github-username.github.io/your-repo/.

Open in Browser: Double-click the saved .html file to open it in your preferred web browser.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the content.

Tailwind CSS: For utility-first styling and responsive design.

Font Awesome: For icons used throughout the presentation.

JavaScript: For interactive elements like slide navigation, audio control, and the progress bar.

Customization
You can easily customize the content, styling, or add more slides by editing the HTML and CSS directly. Ensure that for any new slides, you add a corresponding <audio> tag with the correct id (e.g., audio-10 for slide-10) and update the src attribute to your hosted audio file.# aiaugmentedattendance
